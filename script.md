> The main benefit of low-code and no-code platforms is the speed they offer. Tasks that used to require months of development can now be completed in just a few days. These platforms also empower non-technical users to take part in creating applications and tools themselves. This helps reduce costs because companies don’t need to rely on large development teams for every project. Most importantly, it fuels innovation by enabling employees from different areas to design solutions that fit their own needs. In essence, it gives everyone the ability to turn ideas into tangible results.
