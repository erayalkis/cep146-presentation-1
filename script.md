## Section 1 – Introduction & Context (Mert, ~35 sec)

Hi everyone, today our group will talk about the rise of low-code and no-code platforms — one of the biggest shifts in software development today.

These platforms let people build apps and websites without writing much code, using simple drag-and-drop tools and visual interfaces.

They’ve become popular because they make software creation faster, easier, and more accessible. Examples include Microsoft Power Apps, OutSystems, Bubble, and Webflow.

In short, they’re changing who can build technology, giving everyone the power to turn ideas into real solutions.


## Section 2 – Growth & Drivers (Fatih, ~35 sec)

Low-code and no-code platforms are growing rapidly worldwide. Businesses are under pressure to innovate faster and cut development costs, and these tools help achieve that. They also support rapid prototyping and make it easier to adapt to remote and hybrid work needs. Importantly, they empower what we call ‘citizen developers’—non-technical employees who can now build useful tools alongside IT teams. According to Gartner, by 2025, 70 percent of new applications will be created with low-code or no-code.

> The main benefit of low-code and no-code platforms is the speed they offer. Tasks that used to require months of development can now be completed in just a few days. These platforms also empower non-technical users to take part in creating applications and tools themselves. This helps reduce costs because companies don’t need to rely on large development teams for every project. Most importantly, it fuels innovation by enabling employees from different areas to design solutions that fit their own needs. In essence, it gives everyone the ability to turn ideas into tangible results.

## Section 4 – Challenges & Future (Arzu, ~35 sec)
> While powerful, these platforms do face core challenges that IT leaders must address. First, there's the issue of vendor lock in. Once an application is built on aspecific low-code platform, migrating the data and logic to a different system, or even to custom code, can be extremely difficult and costly, limiting long-term flexibility.
  We also have serious risks associated with goverance and shadow IT, where employees build internal apps wthout proper security oversight, creating vulnerabilities.
Low-code will not replace professional developers; instead, it frees them to focus on those high-value, complex tasks, while empowering buisness users to solve everyday problems. The fusion of citizen developers, IT and AI will make the development landscape faster, smarter, and far more inclusive.
