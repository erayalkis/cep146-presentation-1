> The main benefit of low-code and no-code platforms is the speed they offer. Tasks that used to require months of development can now be completed in just a few days. These platforms also empower non-technical users to take part in creating applications and tools themselves. This helps reduce costs because companies don’t need to rely on large development teams for every project. Most importantly, it fuels innovation by enabling employees from different areas to design solutions that fit their own needs. In essence, it gives everyone the ability to turn ideas into tangible results.

## Section 4 – Challenges & Future (Arzu, ~35 sec)
> While powerful, these platforms do face core challenges that IT leaders must address. First, there's the issue of vendor lock in. Once an application is built on aspecific low-code platform, migrating the data and logic to a different system, or even to custom code, can be extremely difficult and costly, limiting long-term flexibility.
  We also have serious risks associated with goverance and shadow IT, where employees build internal apps wthout proper security oversight, creating vulnerabilities.
Low-code will not replace professional developers; instead, it frees them to focus on those high-value, complex tasks, while empowering buisness users to solve everyday problems. The fusion of citizen developers, IT and AI will make the development landscape faster, smarter, and far more inclusive.
