🧠 Topic Summary

Low-code and no-code platforms are tools that let people build applications without needing advanced programming skills.
Instead of writing long lines of code, users can use visual editors, drag-and-drop interfaces, and logic blocks to create functional software.

These platforms are becoming essential in today’s software industry because they save time, lower costs, and make technology accessible to more people.
Examples include Microsoft Power Apps, OutSystems, Bubble, and Webflow — all enabling faster and easier app development across industries.

📈 Why This Topic Matters

According to Gartner, by 2025 around 70% of new applications will be developed using low-code or no-code tools.
This trend reflects how companies are embracing digital transformation and empowering “citizen developers” — non-technical employees who can now create tools to improve their workflows.

In 2025, this movement is expanding further as low-code merges with AI, making automation and app development even more accessible to everyone.
